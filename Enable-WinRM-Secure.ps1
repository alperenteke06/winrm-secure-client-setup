.SYNOPSIS
    Securely enables WinRM on a client machine over HTTP (no SSL), restricted to specific IP addresses and authorized users.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script configures the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service in a production-safe way:
    - Starts and configures the WinRM listener on HTTP (port 5985)
    - Limits access to specific admin IP addresses via firewall
    - Adds only a specific domain user to the "Remote Management Users" group
    - Ensures WinRM service is set to auto-start

    - Intended to be executed locally on the client machine (e.g., panel PCs).
    - Replace domain, user, and IP values with your own before use.
